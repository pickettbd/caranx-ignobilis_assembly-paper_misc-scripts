# Caranx-ignobilis_assembly-paper_misc-scripts
Misc. scripts referenced in my genome assembly paper for _Caranx ignobilis_

## Usage
`python3 agp2fa.py input.agp input_contigs.fa output_scaffolds.fa`
`python3 combineHicRna.py` # edit file names inside script

## Note
These scripts are not connected to eachother. No order is implied about how/when they should be run. This is simply a convenient way to make this code available for anyone who wishes to see it after reading our paper.
